# Week 1 Win Plan: Maximize Points, Position for #1

**Goal:** Score the most points in Week 1 and establish a lead.  
**Theme:** Data Visualization & Interactions  
**Deadline:** Sunday 11:59 PM CT

---

## 1. How Week 1 Points Work (Quick Math)

| Source | Points | Multiplier | Notes |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| LinkedIn post | 5 | 1× or 2× | Per build/content |
| YouTube (≥5 min, PiP) | 15 | 1× or 2× | PiP required full video |
| Personal blog | 2 | 1× or 2× | |
| Substack post | 2 | 1× or 2× | |
| **Bonus: theme** | +10 | once | Clearly in data viz |
| **Bonus: competitor ref** | +10 | once | Link/shout-out to another entrant |

**Multipliers:** No public code = **0×** (don’t). Public repo = **1×**. Hosted app + public repo = **2×**.

**To win Week 1:** You need **2× on everything** (hosted + repo), **all four channels**, and **both bonuses**. One strong build can do that.

---

## 2. Target Score for Week 1 (Single Build, Maxed Out)

Assume **one** solid data viz app, **hosted + public repo** (2×), and **all channels + both bonuses**:

- LinkedIn: 5 × 2 = **10**
- YouTube: 15 × 2 = **15**
- Blog: 2 × 2 = **4**
- Substack: 2 × 2 = **4**
- Bonus (theme): **10**
- Bonus (competitor): **10**

**Total: 53 points** from one build, one week.

If most people ship one thing and only do LinkedIn or YouTube, 53 puts you in the lead. If someone else goes full channels too, consider **two small builds** (see Optional Stretch below).

---

## 3. The One Build: Keep It Small and On-Theme

**Pick one idea you can finish in a few days.** Examples that fit “data visualization & interactions”:

- **Option A:** Interactive chart from a CSV or API (e.g. CO2, weather, or any public dataset) with filters or time scrubber.
- **Option B:** Simple dashboard (e.g. Spotify-style listening stats, GitHub activity, or fitness data) with at least one chart and click/filter.
- **Option C:** Single-purpose “boring but good” business chart with clear interactions (tooltips, zoom, filter by category).

**Requirements for 2× and bonuses:**

- **Hosted:** Deploy to Vercel / Netlify / etc. Public URL, no login (or provide test credentials).
- **Repo:** Public GitHub, README (what it is, how to run, link to live app), at least one screenshot (e.g. in README or `/screenshots`).
- **Theme:** In your write-ups and video, state clearly that it’s “data visualization & interactions” and show the viz + interaction.
- **Competitor ref:** In one post or video, reference one other competitor’s post/app/code (link or clear shout-out) for +10.

## 4. Week 1 Day-by-Day Plan

### **Mon–Tue: Build**

- **Mon:** Choose dataset + stack (e.g. React + Recharts, or Vue + Chart.js, or vanilla + a small lib). Get “hello chart” on screen and one interaction (filter/click/scrub).
- **Tue:** Finish core viz and interactions. Add README (what it is, how to run, link to live app), screenshot, then push to **public** repo and **deploy** so you have 2× locked in.

### **Wed: Content Drafts**

- **LinkedIn:** Short post (what you built, why, one lesson). Link to repo + live app.
- **Blog / Substack:** Same story, a bit longer (what, how, what you’d do next). Link to repo, live app, and **one competitor** (for +10).
- **YouTube script/outline:** 5–7 min. Intro → what it is → quick demo (interactions) → how you built it → theme + competitor callout. Plan where you’ll say “data visualization and interactions” and “shout-out to [competitor].”

### **Thu: Record YouTube**

- **Tool:** Zoom, you only. Screen share + **Picture-in-Picture for entire video** (required).
- **Length:** ≥5 minutes.
- **Include:** What it is, live demo, “this week’s theme is data viz and interactions,” and one competitor reference.
- **Check:** Export and skim to ensure PiP never drops (or re-record that section).

### **Fri: Publish Everywhere**

- **LinkedIn:** Publish, link to app + repo (and optionally video).
- **Blog:** Publish, same links + competitor ref.
- **Substack:** Publish (can be same or shortened version), same links + competitor ref.
- **YouTube:** Upload, title/description with repo + live app links.

### **Sat–Sun: Share and Buffer**

- **Sat:** Send Eric **all links** (LinkedIn, YouTube, blog, Substack, repo, live app) in one message so scoring is easy.
- **Sun:** Buffer for fixes (e.g. if PiP issue found, re-upload YouTube before 11:59 PM CT).

## 5. Repo Checklist (Avoid 0× or 1×)

Before you call the build “done”:

- [ ] Repo is **public**
- [ ] **README.md** at root: what it is (1–2 sentences), how to run it, **link to live app**
- [ ] At least **one screenshot** (in README or `/screenshots` / `/assets`)
- [ ] App **deployed** and URL in README; no login or provide test credentials
- [ ] If fork: **meaningful changes** (features, UX, data, or docs), not just config/skin

---

## 6. Submission Checklist (So Nothing Gets Missed)

Send to Eric by Sunday 11:59 PM CT:

- [ ] LinkedIn post link  
- [ ] YouTube video link (≥5 min, PiP whole time)  
- [ ] Blog post link  
- [ ] Substack post link  
- [ ] GitHub repo link  
- [ ] Live app URL  

In at least one place (video or post): clear **theme** callout and **competitor** reference.

---

## 7. Optional Stretch: Two Builds (If You Have Time)

If you want to push for more than 53:

- **Build 2:** Second small data viz (different dataset or interaction type). Same rules: hosted, public repo, README, screenshot.
- **Content:** You can do one LinkedIn per build (5+5 = 10 base × 2 = 20), or one extra YouTube (15 × 2 = 30). Blog/Substack can cover both in one post or split.
- **Bonuses:** Still +10 theme (once), +10 competitor (once). So second build mainly adds channel points × 2 for the extra content.

Only do this if Build 1 is done and you have time; one maxed-out build is already a strong Week 1.

---

## 8. Summary: Why This Gets You #1 for Week 1

- **One focused build** that’s clearly data viz + interactions, **hosted + public repo** → 2× on all content.
- **All four channels** (LinkedIn, YouTube, blog, Substack) → maximum base points from that build.
- **Both bonuses** (+10 theme, +10 competitor) → +20.
- **Clean submission** (one message to Eric with all links) → no scoring confusion.

Execute this and you’re in the top tier for Week 1; then repeat the same playbook (small ship, all channels, 2×, bonuses) for the next four weeks to stay #1 overall.
