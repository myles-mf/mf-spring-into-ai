# Week 1 Project Plan

**Theme:** Data Visualization & Interactions  
**Deadline:** Sunday 11:59 PM CT  
**Target:** 53 points (one build, all channels, 2× multiplier, both bonuses)

---

## Goal

Ship one small, interactive data visualization: **hosted app + public repo**, then publish on all four channels (LinkedIn, YouTube, blog, Substack) with clear theme callout and one competitor reference.

---

## The Build (High Level)

- **What:** A single-page app that visualizes a dataset and lets users interact with it (filter, click, scrub, or toggle).
- **Stack:** React + Vite + Recharts (or similar). Easy to deploy on Vercel.
- **Data:** One CSV or public API — keep it small (e.g. a few hundred rows or a simple endpoint).
- **Interaction:** At least one clear interaction: filter by category, click for details, time range scrubber, or toggle chart type.

## Timeline Options

| Approach | When | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|
| **One day** | Pick a day (e.g. Saturday) | 5–8 hours focused. Build → content → record → publish. |
| **Two days** | Day 1: build + deploy. Day 2: content + record + publish. | Less pressure, buffer for bugs. |
| **Spread** | Mon–Tue build, Wed content, Thu record, Fri publish, Sat submit. | As in WEEK1-WIN-PLAN.md. |

Use **TRACKER.md** to mark off tasks as you go. Use **GUIDE.md** for step-by-step instructions.
