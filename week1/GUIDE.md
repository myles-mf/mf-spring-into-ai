# Week 1 Step-by-Step Guide

Use this with **TRACKER.md** — check off each item in the tracker as you complete the steps below.

---

## Part 1: The Build

### 1.1 Get the app running locally

- Open a terminal in `week1/data-viz-app/`.
- Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
- Confirm the app loads at the URL shown (e.g. http://localhost:5173).

### 1.2 Choose your data and interaction

The scaffold uses sample data and a simple chart. Decide:

- **Keep sample data** and add one interaction (e.g. filter by category, toggle series), or  
- **Swap in your own data:** replace the data file or API in the app and adjust the chart.

**Interaction ideas (pick at least one):**

- Filter dropdown (e.g. by category, region, year).
- Click a bar/point to show details or highlight.
- Toggle between chart types (bar vs line).
- Slider or inputs to filter by range (e.g. date range, value range).

Implement the interaction in the app so it’s obvious in a 30-second demo.

### 1.3 Polish and verify

- [ ] Chart and interaction work without errors.
- [ ] Page has a short title/description so it’s clear what the viz is.
- [ ] Test in a couple of browsers or window sizes if you care about responsiveness.

### 1.4 Repo requirements (for 2× multiplier)

- [ ] **README.md** in the app root (or repo root you’ll submit) with:
  - **What it is:** 1–2 sentences.
  - **How to run it:** e.g. `npm install`, `npm run dev`, and any env steps.
  - **Link to live app:** add this after you deploy (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`).
- [ ] **Screenshot:** Add at least one (e.g. in README, or in `/screenshots` or `/assets`).  
  Take a screenshot of the viz with the interaction visible (e.g. a filter selected).

### 1.5 Deploy

- Push the app to GitHub (public repo). If the whole repo is SpringIntoAI, ensure the app lives in a clear path (e.g. `week1/data-viz-app/`) and the README you submit describes that.
- Deploy to **Vercel** (or Netlify / Render):
  - Connect the repo; set root to the app folder (e.g. `week1/data-viz-app`).
  - After deploy, copy the live URL and put it in the README.
- [ ] Open the live URL in an incognito window — no login required (or add test credentials to README).

## Part 2: Content

### 2.1 LinkedIn post

- 1–3 short paragraphs: what you built, why, one lesson.
- Include links: **live app** and **repo** (and optionally YouTube once it’s up).
- Don’t save as draft too long — publish when ready.

### 2.2 Blog post (optional)

- Skip if you don’t have a blog. Use LinkedIn + Substack only (see **DRAFT-POSTS.md**).

### 2.3 Substack post

- Can be the same text as the blog or a shortened version.
- Same links: **live app**, **repo**, **competitor reference**.
- Publish on Substack.

### 2.4 YouTube outline / script

- **Length:** 5–7 minutes.
- **Structure:**  
  - Intro (who you are, what you’re doing).  
  - What the app is (one sentence).  
  - Live demo: show the viz and use the interaction.  
  - How you built it (stack, data, one challenge).  
  - Say clearly: “This week’s theme is data visualization and interactions.”  
  - One competitor shout-out: “I’m referencing [name/link]…”
- Plan where you’ll say the theme and the competitor so you don’t forget.

## Part 3: Record YouTube

### 3.1 Setup

- Use **Zoom** (solo meeting). Start meeting → Share screen (your app or browser).
- Ensure **Picture-in-Picture** is on and **you are on camera the entire time** (no “intro only”).
- Recording: Record to your computer (not just cloud if that hides PiP).

### 3.2 Record

- Hit record. Do your 5–7 min: intro → demo → how you built it → theme + competitor.
- Stop recording. Export/save the video.

### 3.3 Check before upload

- Skim the whole video: **you must be visible (PiP) for the full duration.** If PiP drops for more than a tiny fraction, re-record that section or the whole thing.
- Confirm length is ≥5 minutes.

---

## Part 4: Publish and Submit

### 4.1 Publish everywhere

- [ ] **LinkedIn:** Publish post with app + repo (and video link if you want).
- [ ] **Blog:** Publish post with app + repo + competitor ref.
- [ ] **Substack:** Publish post with app + repo + competitor ref.
- [ ] **YouTube:** Upload video. Title/description: include **live app** and **repo** links. Ensure your channel has your first or last name in the channel name.

### 4.2 Send to Eric

- In **one message**, send Eric:
  - LinkedIn post link  
  - YouTube video link  
  - Blog post link  
  - Substack post link  
  - GitHub repo link  
  - Live app URL  

- Do this **before Sunday 11:59 PM CT** so it counts for Week 1.

### 4.3 Buffer (Sunday)

- If you notice a PiP issue or broken link, fix and re-upload or edit before the deadline.
- No need to resend to Eric for tiny edits unless you change a URL.

## Quick reference: scoring

- **2× multiplier:** Public repo (README + screenshot) + hosted app (public URL in README).
- **Theme bonus (+10):** Clearly say “data visualization and interactions” and show the viz + interaction (e.g. in video or posts).
- **Competitor bonus (+10):** One clear reference (link or shout-out) in a post or the video.

Use **TRACKER.md** to tick off each task as you go.
