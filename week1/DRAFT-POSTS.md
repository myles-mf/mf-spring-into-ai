Week 1 of the Spring Into AI Build Sprint is in the books.

I built **ChartSlice** — a small interactive bar chart where you slice the data by category. This week’s theme was data visualization and interactions, so I kept it simple: one chart, one filter, ship it.

Tech: React, Vite, Recharts. Code is public and the app is live.

Try it: [LIVE APP URL]

Repo: [REPO URL]

If you’re in the sprint too, drop your Week 1 build in the comments. [Optional: Shout-out to [COMPETITOR NAME] — link in first comment.]

### ChartSlice — Week 1 of the Spring Into AI Build Sprint

This week’s theme was **data visualization and interactions**. I didn’t overthink it: I built a single-page app that shows a bar chart and lets you filter by category. Call it **ChartSlice** — you’re literally slicing the dataset with a dropdown.

**What it is:** A bar chart of sample monthly data (you can swap in your own CSV or API). The interaction is a “Filter by category” dropdown: All, A, or B. Pick one and the chart updates. Simple, but it fits the theme — data on screen, user in control.

**How I built it:** React 18, Vite, Recharts. The data lives in state; changing the filter updates the array we pass to the chart. Deployed to Vercel so anyone can use it without cloning the repo.

**Try it:** [LIVE APP URL]  
**Code:** [REPO URL]

One lesson: small and shipped beats big and perfect. Five weeks of this and the goal is momentum, not polish.

If you’re also in the sprint, I’d love to see what you built. Shout-out to [COMPETITOR NAME] for [what they did] — [link]. That’s the kind of cross-reference the competition rewards.

More next week.

**Before you publish:** Replace every `[LIVE APP URL]`, `[REPO URL]`, and `[COMPETITOR NAME]` / link with your real values.
